This article narrows down the minority of first-generation college students further into one of the first-generation Latinx students. Using the critical race theory and community cultural wealth framework to look at the challenges that first-gen Latinx students face at a PWI (primarily white institution), the study aims to understand how race, classism, and social status contribute to the success of first-generation Latinx students. The students are all in an academic support group and they look to see what challenges they face during their journey in academia. 
	We already know that people with a college education are likely to get paid more (statistically speaking) and have greater job security. But how many of those people come from a family that already has a history of college degrees? Currently, many college graduates have returned to customer service jobs due to being unable to land a professional job in the area they have studied. With this in mind, what is the job security market looking like for first-generation college students? Specifically first-generation Latinx students? The support for first-generation students is lacking and they face a different set of challenges than other students. I will be looking into whether a college education aids first-generation college students in landing a job.
