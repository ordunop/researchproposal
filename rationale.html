  <h1>Rationale</h1>
  <h2>The Questions I Will be Exploring</h2>
  <p>The questions I will be exploring will be: does a college education aid in job security? Does a college degree help first-generation college students get a well-paying job? And if first-generation Latinx students are able to get a successful career after college? The overall issue is college graduates struggling to land a well-paying job. Specifically, the struggle first-generation Latinx graduates face due to them having rarely having connections in the professional workforce, given that they are the first in their family to do so. I hypothesize that overall first-generation college students are not experiencing the same success in post-graduate employment when compared to their peers that come from generational education. A second hypothesis is that first-generation Latinx students are being hired at a lower rate than White first-generation students. A third hypothesis is that when compared to other Latinx people, getting a college degree aids a considerable amount when entering the professional workforce. If my hypothesis is confirmed it will show that job security increases when first-generation Latinx students receive a college education. If it is proven false it will show that a college degree has about the same results in job security when compared to someone that does not have a college degree. Finally, if my hypothesis is incorrect, what will be found is that White and Latinx students are experiencing the same rates of job security after graduation.</p>
