  <h2 style="background-color:lightcoral;color:blue;font-family:verdana;">A Literature Review on Previous Studies</h2> 
  <p style="color:SlateBlue;font-family:verdana;font-size:90%> A study done by Allan et al. (2016), they examine the effects of classism and social class on students' academic and personal life. Social class was analyzed to see how it influenced their academic success and the success they experienced after completing their studies. The participants were 1,225 college students attending a large public university in the midwest (U.S). It was found that social class had an overall effect on college graduates, which resulted in lower graduation rates, but it should not be assumed that all first-generation students are from a lower socioeconomic background. This is related to the proposed research because there are so many factors that can contribute to employment after college, such as knowing the right people, being financially stable, and having social support. Being able to take unpaid internships for the sake of experience is not something that is viable for many college graduates, as they have just graduated and are looking to make money to sustain themselves. Aside from having to support themselves, they are more than likely in debt due to the expense that is college. Being able to have outside financial support due to being from a financially stable family is a luxury that not many college graduates are able to rely on.</p>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;font-family:verdana;font-size:90%>In a study done by SÃ¡nchez-Connally, they look at the effects of race, gender, and class that Latinx students experience during college. Rather than looking at a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds that make up first-generation college students, this study looks at Latinx college students. The qualitative study uses the Critical Race Theory to describe the experiences that Latinx students experience at primarily white institutions (PWIs). The study consists of Latinx students that have already graduated from a four-year college, and they discuss the challenges they faced, and how they were able to overcome them to ultimately succeed and graduate. This study is a great example of a qualitative approach that could be applied to the research proposal at hand. The study looked at the unique challenges that Latinx students encountered in college and could be applied to the unique set of challenges that Latinx first-generation students face when seeking post-graduate employment.</p>
