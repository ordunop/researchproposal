  <h2 style="background-color:daksalmon;color:blue;font-family:verdana;">How the Study Will be Performed</h2>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;font-family:verdana;font-size:90%">To obtain the data, participants need to first be identified to be interviewed. To do so surveys will be sent out to alumni from Portland State University, they will then identify if they are first-generation graduates and if they come from a Latinx background. From there those that have confirmed their background will be asked to participate in an interview that will ask them about their experiences upon graduating college, and how useful they felt their degree truly was. The interviewees will be both White and Latinx graduates that are experiencing the results of their college education, and whether or not their college degree aided them in landing a job after graduation. The groups that will be interviewed will be White graduates, White first-generation graduates, and Latinx first-generation graduates. Latinx is very diverse, so for the sake of this study, people who self-identify as Latinx will need to have a Latinx-sounding name/last name. The reason for this is because of how applicable it is on paper, before someone is able to get an interview an employer will see the name of an applicant and be able to make a racial assumption from it.</p>
  <p style="color:SlateBlue;font-family:verdana;font-size:90%">To collect data for my research question I would interview first-gen Latinx college graduates in the Portland area. Ask them about their experiences while in college and after graduating, and how they ended up at the job they are at currently. I would compare this data to the data collected from White first-generation college graduates, to see if the Critical Race Theory is as big of a factor as it is thought to be. Both of these groups will be compared to the employment rates of college graduates that are not first-generation, in other words to students that come from a family that has a history of a college education. With the pandemic as a factor, it could be interesting to see how this affected employment among first-generation Latinx graduates because of the employment rates being so low in all areas of the workforce. An interview method would be the best approach as I would get to hear the personal struggles and ambitions of people throughout the years, the group of people in Portland who are first-generation Latinx students is also a small, underrepresented group that could use their voice to speak up about the issues they have faced. Hearing from the people that are living/ being affected by the matter is what is going to give us the most accurate data, as far as the Portland area goes. The people that would be able interviewed would-be first-generation college graduates and White college graduates that come from a family with a college education. Withing the first-generation group there will be two control groups consisting of White first-generation graduates, and another consisting of Latinx college graduates. Having the comparison of White and Latinx graduates would help test the aid of a degree when it comes to job security, as it tests to see if it is about the degree or a racial issue. The type of degree a person has will be taken into consideration and will further narrow down the statistical comparison. Certain degrees are ridiculed because they are deemed “useless” and “inapplicable to a job”, so this will be a factor to consider when analyzing the study results.</p>
<h3>The Portland Area:</h3>

<p style="color:SlateBlue;font-family:verdana;font-size:90%">To test my hypothesis, I would ask the interviewees about how they got into college and why they decided to go into college. The interview would consist of questions such as: did you have guidance when applying to college? Why did you apply to college? What was your major in undergrad? Do you have a job at this moment, if so is it related to your major? Why did you choose the major you ended up studying? As well as asking them what their goal was upon entering college and what kind of social support they had during their time in college, and how that helped them after graduation. A varying factor that can affect the employment rate of someone with a college degree could be the type of degree they acquired, but that is also a whole issue within itself, how useful/valuable degrees are to the employment world. I would ask the participants what they experienced upon entering the workforce after college, and what type of work they found themselves doing, as oftentimes Latinx people will be pushed to labor work as that is the type of work many grow up around. The Critical Race Theory can be applied here as they do affect how a Latinx person will be seen and how they see themselves as a member of society, often limiting themselves in what work they pursue. My hypothesis is that if first-generation college students get a college education it will not aid them in job security. To disprove this, I would need data that shows Latinx graduates are successfully getting employed in their field of study, at an equal rate of White college graduates. If Latinx people are getting hired at the same rate as their White peers, then that would prove it is truly all about the degree they have, but if they were not, it would mean racial and social class factors are affecting the effectiveness of their degree. I would also need to compare how people who come from a family of other college-educated adults are being hired in comparison to first-generation graduates, as this would support my hypothesis because it would prove it is more about connections you and your family have as opposed to what education people have acquired.</p>

  <p style="color:SlateBlue;font-family:verdana;font-size:90%">Upon analyzing the data we will look at employment rates for White first-generation graduates, Latinx first-generation graduates, and how that compares to the employment of people coming from educated families. If both first-generation college graduates are not being employed at the same rate as their peers then that would support my hypothesis. Though if first-generation Latinx students are being hired at a lower rate than other first-generation students then that would falsify my hypothesis, making the difficulty of employment a racial issue that outweighs the educational factor. The goal is to determine if a college education will aid in job security, as of recent years educated people with bachelor's degrees are stuck working service jobs.</p>
