  <h2>Why the Study is Important</h2>
<p>Researching what I have proposed would help the field as it contributes to the discussion of why people are not getting employed. There are jobs out there but why are they so difficult to land? Even after going through the hard work of being in college. It can help identify whether there needs to be more discussion about getting a job after college, and help provide support for the people that could struggle to get a professional job after college. Looking into the employment of college graduates helps in identifying how we can minimalize the issue at hand, and possibly discuss with big employers an approach to increasing professional job employment. Factors that contribute to employment are the type of degree someone has pursued, whether they have connections, their racial identity, gender, and appearance all play a role in how likely someone is to get hired. This can help shade light on the many factors that affect adults in the workforce, such as racial prejudice, networking difficulties, and the viability of a college education.</p>
