<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;color:darkgreen;">Is a College Degree The New High School Diploma?"</h1>

		<p style="color:SlateBlue;">The new generation of college-educated adults is not seeing the same job security as before, it can be compared to a high school diploma. At first, the high school diploma was something many people strived to accomplish, as it was said to guarantee better employment. Over the years a high school diploma started becoming nothing more than a piece of paper saying you graduated high school. People started seeing the high school diploma become less effective at aiding in the employment process, and so people started going for bachelor's degrees. Now young people are experiencing great difficulties in employment post-college and struggling to put their degree to its intended use. Instead, college graduates are settling for retail or food service jobs that have nothing to do with what they studied, and find themselves stuck in a cycle of being unable to find professional employment that doesnâ€™t require years of experience. Experience cannot be obtained if companies are not willing to teach, and unpaid experience is not something that should be expected of college graduates that are intending to make a living. </p>

<p style="color:SlateBlue;">The issue I will be examining is job security among first-generation college graduates. Whether or not a college education actually aids in helping first-generation students achieve a successful career. This is important to the education system and expectations that we have of young adults, college is pushed on so many people and yet we see so many young educated people struggling to get into their career of study. A focus point of the study will be to compare employment rates among white first-generation college graduates to the employment rates among Latinx first-generation college graduates. Latinx people have been known in the U.S as a driving force in hard labor jobs, but once they are put in competition with their white peers they seem to fall short (in terms of employment rates) in professional corporate jobs.</p>
